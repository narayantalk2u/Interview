/**
 * Problem desciption:
 * Stock Buy Sell to Maximize Profit
 *
 * Given a list of stock prices for n days, find the maximum profit with a single buy or sell activity.
 *
 * Explanation:
 * Given a list of daily stock prices (integers for simplicity), return the buy and sell prices for making the
 * maximum profit. We need to maximize the single buy/sell profit. If we can’t make any profit, we’ll try to
 * minimize the loss.
 *
 * Solution: Use Kadane’s algorithm.
 * Runtime complexity #
 *
 * The runtime complexity of this solution is linear, O(n).
 * Memory complexity #
 *
 * The memory complexity of this algorithm is constant, O(1).
 *
 * The values in the array represent the cost of a stock each day. As we can buy and sell the stock only once,
 * we need to find the best buy and sell prices for which our profit is maximized (or loss is minimized) over a
 * given span of time.
 *
 * A naive solution, with runtime complexity of O(n^2), is to find the maximum gain between each element and its
 * succeeding elements.
 *
 * There is a tricky linear solution to this problem that requires maintaining current_buy_price (which is the
 * smallest number seen so far), current_profit, and global_profit as we iterate through the entire array of stock prices. At each iteration, we will compare the current_profit with the global_profit and update the global_profit accordingly.
 *
 * The basic algorithm is as follows:
 *
 * current profit = INT_MIN
 * current buy = stock_prices[0]
 * global sell = stock_prices[1]
 * global profit = global sell - current buy
 *
 * for i = 1 to stock_prices.length:
 *   current profit = stock_prices[i] - current buy
 *   if current profit is greater than global profit
 *     then update global profit to current profit and update global sell to stock_prices[i]
 *   if stock_prices[i] is less than current buy
 *     then update current buy to stock_prices[i]
 *
 * return global profit and global sell
