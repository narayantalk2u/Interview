/**
 * Move All Zeros to the Beginning of the Array
 *
 * Move all zeros to the left of an array while maintaining its order.
 * Description #
 *
 * Given an integer array, move all elements that are 0 to the left while maintaining the order of other elements in
 * the array. The array has to be modified in-place.
 *
 * Solution #
 * Runtime complexity #
 *
 * The runtime complexity if this solution is linear, O(n)O(n)O(n).
 * Memory complexity #
 *
 * The memory complexity of this solution is constant, O(1)O(1)O(1).
 *
 * We will keep two markers: read_index and write_index and point them to the end of the array. Letâ€™s take a look at an overview of the algorithm:
 *
 * While moving read_index towards the start of the array:
 *
 *     If read_index points to 0, skip.
 *     If read_index points to a non-zero value, write the value at read_index to write_index and decrement write_index.
 *     Assign zeros to all the values before the write_index and to the current position of write_index as well.
